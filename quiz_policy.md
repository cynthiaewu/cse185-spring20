# CSE 185 Spring 2020 quiz policy

Quizzes will be held at the beginning of Wednesday labs (weeks 2, 4, and 6). They will be 20 minutes long. Each quiz is worth 3% of the total course grade.

You will be allowed access to a terminal and a 1-page cheat sheet (front and back ok).

You *may not*:
* Access the internet besides through the terminal.
* Chat or in any other way communicate with other people for help
* Use other devices besides the lab computers (e.g. phone, calculators). If you need a calculator - use the terminal! (e.g. python)
