# CSE 185 Spring 2020 quiz policy

Quizzes will be held at the beginning of Wednesday labs (weeks 2, 4, and 6). They will be 20 minutes long. Each quiz is worth 5% of the total course grade.

Quizzes will be held remotely, most likely using Jupyter Notebooks.

You will be allowed access to course materials on JupyterHub.

You *may not*:
* Access the internet besides through JupyterHub.
* Chat or in any other way communicate with other people for help

Obviously we cannot easily enforce these rules when quizzes are administered remotely. We are counting on you to be honest.
