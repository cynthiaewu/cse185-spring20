## Accessing assignments

1. Go to [datahub.ucsd.edu](datahub.ucsd.edu). Log in with your active directory account (UCSD Google account). If you are having trouble logging in with Chrome, try using an incognito window.

2. Spawn the CSE185 course.

3. Click on the "Assignments" tab

4. Look for released assignments and "fetch" the assignment.

5. Once fetched, you should be able to see the individual notebook files for each lab. Click prelab 1 to begin!

## Submitting assignments

From the assignments tab, for each notebook, you can click "Validate" to check that you pass all visible autograder tests. 

When you are ready to submit the assignment, simply click "Submit"

## Turning in assignments late

* Submissions are due on Sundays 11:59:59 PM
* Late submissions will be accepted until 4 days after the deadline (Thursday 11:59:59 PM)
* 5 points will be deducted for each late day (see syllabus for the late policy details).
* Only the grade on the latest submission will be considered. For example, if the grade received for the lab submitted before the deadline is higher than the grade received on the latest submission, then the lower grade will be considered. So please do not click "submit" again after you have submitted the version you want to be graded.

## Regrades

We will be allowing regrades of lab assignments but you must specify exactly which questions you believe were graded incorrectly and justify why you think you should get points back.

You must ask for regrades within one week of receiving feedback for the assignment.

Please request regrades through private Piazza messages to ensure we see them.
